<h1>Resting and Meditation Equipment</h1>
<p>Resting is important for the mind and body. Personally, I believe that your soul never rests. But your mind and body do. Look at resting as on a technological view point from when we started developing more and more in computers and electricity, once a computer heats up to a point, it needs to cool down so a circuit doesn't short or the copper wares out. It's the exact same with your body, your cells need time from the tear from all the activities you do from the day before. And it doesn't matter what you do. This is followed by depending on what you do will determine on what kind of rest you give your body.</p>
