<h1>History</h1>
<p>Why is history important? Well, history teaches and reinforces what we believe in, what we stand for and what we ought to stand for. History also prevents people from repeating itself, mistakes and accomplishments. It gives us examples and perceptions and appreciation through other people.</p>
<p>History is more than just the people and memorizing dates, it's learning lessons and effectiveness. The cause and effect of what as already happened.</p>
