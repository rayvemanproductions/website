<h1>History</h1>
<p>Through history, we have altered, modified and perverted our own history -either good or bad-. Here are several factors in this: greed, lack of vocabolary, misinteruptations, primitive understandings and lack of knowledge. Often, our ancestors described things that they hardly understood. There are many common themes that today seem a little off.</p>
<p>Why is history important? Well, history teaches and reinforces what we believe in, what we stand for and what we ought to stand for. History also prevents people from repeating itself, mistakes and accomplishments. It gives us examples and perceptions and appreciation through other people.</p>
<p>History is more than just the people and memorizing dates, it's learning lessons and effectiveness. The cause and effect of what as already happened.</p>
