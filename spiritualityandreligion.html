<p>The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion.

Humans have a unique difference over the other species of consciousness because of our primative verbal and written communication, we're more individual in personality and uniqueness in character. Other species travel in packs and communicate through thought and emtions.<br> Which leads us to our next point: Emotions.<br> Emotions are much, much more powerful and thoughts. Emotions are a drive, a stimuli to your physical and mental states. It adapts you to psychological and envirenmental changes and pridicts responses to situations. Emotions are unique for every situations. It's a naturally occuring judgement that are distinct to each personality.
