<h1>This page is dedicated to being a healthy human being!</h1>
<p>Health as been an important factor through out the history of the Earth, no matter what specie it may be. On a basic instinctual nature of life it means that the offspring will also be healthy. And even now that's a very important. Though now, it's about self image and functionality. What ever your reason may be please use this a basic guide and a reference to perfect your advantages. 
As part of being healthy, having healthy relationships is also a great factor on your psychological health. Keeping in mind that I'm a hermit myself, I'll have a section dedicated for people who just don't like people and prefer to keep to themselves.</p>
