<h1>Proper Food Storage</h1>
<p>Tired of mold, if not soggy leftovers? Or, wanna store your food for long term agendas or even the apocolypse? This page will help you with that. In this section we're going to discuss how you can store you food for tomorrow, a week from now or for even a year or two. Now suppose we are expected by physiology to eat five times a day, that by it's self will deternmine how much of what you need to store.</p>
<p>What your going to need for this project are:
Several macien jars for your shelves.
A pot to cook the food you'll be storing.
Several gallons of water to boil what is needed.
A stove (or any version of).
A storage area to store your stuff if you don't not have room in your cupboards and refrigerator.
A lot of containers for your meals of the following week.
A freezer to freeze your stuff.
AND
Freezer Air Tight Bags that will protect your food from frostbite.
<em>Note:</em>If your making meals for the week, make them on one of your days off so you don't have to cook as much during the week. especially if you work a lot, on a diet and not that good at time management.
There are several ways you can go about this. First off you can use a crock pot to cook several meals and save the rest. This, however, will take time. So expect a couple of days. Secondly, it's best if you have your own garden. Weather it be outside or inside a greenhouse. Either way if you want to store stuff for the long term with any ingridiants than it is best to get the pot and macien jars.</p>
